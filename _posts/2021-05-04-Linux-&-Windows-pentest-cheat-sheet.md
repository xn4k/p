# Windows : 

Let's check the log                                               - "cd /" and then "dir /s /b *.log"

# Linux : 

at /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt | grep (your_word) > pass.txt - creating wordlist with word in various forms

cd ~                                                              - search for user creds 

cat * | grep pass                                                 - search for pass on this folder 

ls -la                                                            - list all dirs 

sudo -l                                                           - check conditions 

python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
echo os.system('/bin/bash')                                       - breaking out of the shell jail
/bin/sh -i

cat /etc/crontab                                                  - show us crontabs
